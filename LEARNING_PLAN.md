# Chess Learning Plan

## Current Status
**Level:** Beginner (knows piece movements, basic rules)
**Started:** December 7, 2025
**Goal:** Strategic thinking, pattern recognition, understanding the "why" behind moves

---

## Phase 1: Foundations (Current)

The goal isn't memorization—it's building intuition. We're training pattern recognition and strategic thinking.

### Core Concepts to Internalize

- [ ] **Center control** — Why e4/d4/e5/d5 matter
- [ ] **Development** — Get pieces off the back rank, connect rooks
- [ ] **King safety** — Castle early, understand when not to
- [ ] **Piece activity** — A piece doing nothing is worth nothing
- [ ] **Pawn structure** — Pawns can't move backward; every push is permanent

### Tactical Patterns (Basic)

- [ ] **Forks** — One piece attacks two things
- [ ] **Pins** — Piece can't move because something valuable is behind it
- [ ] **Skewers** — Reverse pin (valuable piece in front)
- [ ] **Back rank mate** — King trapped by own pawns
- [ ] **Discovered attacks** — Moving one piece reveals attack from another

### Practice Method
1. Play positions, explain your thinking out loud
2. I'll ask "why that move?" before evaluating
3. Short tactical puzzles (mate in 1, mate in 2)
4. Analyze your games—especially losses

## Phase 2: Strategic Thinking

*Unlock when Phase 1 patterns feel automatic*

### Concepts

- [ ] **Weak squares** — Squares that can't be defended by pawns
- [ ] **Outposts** — Safe squares for pieces deep in enemy territory
- [ ] **Pawn chains** — Attacking the base, not the tip
- [ ] **Open files** — Rooks need highways
- [ ] **Good vs bad bishops** — Are your pawns on the same color?
- [ ] **Knight vs bishop** — Closed vs open positions

### Openings (Light Touch)
Not memorizing lines—understanding *ideas*:
- [ ] Italian Game basics (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4) — rapid development, center control
- [ ] London System basics (1.d4 2.Bf4) — solid, low theory
- [ ] How to respond to 1.e4 and 1.d4 with principled moves

---

## Phase 3: Pattern Library

*Unlock when strategic concepts feel natural*

- [ ] Common mating patterns (Greek gift, Anastasia's mate, Arabian mate)
- [ ] Endgame fundamentals (K+Q vs K, K+R vs K, opposition)
- [ ] Typical middlegame plans based on pawn structure
- [ ] Recognizing when to trade, when to keep pieces

## Notes to Self (Cas)

**Teaching approach:**
- Ask before telling. "What are you seeing?" "What does your opponent want?"
- Evaluate honestly—validation without honesty doesn't help
- Connect patterns to broader strategic thinking
- Keep it active: positions > lectures
